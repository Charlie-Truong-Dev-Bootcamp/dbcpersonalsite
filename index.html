			<h2>Dakota and Lela</h2>
			<p>I have two Siberian huskies.  Dakota is the one in the back.  Lela is upfront.  They are great, loving dogs but can be very stubborn.  
			I'm not 100% sure they know I own them.</p>
			<img src="img/lela_dakota.jpg" alt="Lela and Dakota" class="images">
			<p>Dakota's about 8 years old, and Lela's 4 years old.  We intended Lela to be his playmate, but she may have too much energy for him.
				They will play fight, and Lela does not quite know when to call it quits.  Poor Dakota sometimes just wants to take a nap when Lela 
				pounces on him.</p>

			<h2>Gaming</h2>
			<p>I enjoy video games.  I don't get as much time in as I used to with family commitments.  However, it's good to escape into a different world from time to time.</p>
			<img src="img/ps4.jpg" alt="ps4" class="images">
			<p>This year I attended the Game Developers Conference just for fun.  Hearing some well known developers talk about the passion they have for their art cemented my decision to change careers.</p>
			<p>I should love what I do for a living and not be ashamed to want that.</p>

			<h2>A New Beginning</h2>
			<p>I'm leaving behind a 10 year, decently successful career at Caterpillar, Inc to find a new path at Dev Bootcamp.  I thought most of my family and friends would call me crazy.  However, I was surprised to find everyone supportive.  I'm fortunate enough to have an understanding and loving wife who believes in me.</p>
			<p>Whatever happens, it'll certainly be a wild ride.  See you soon, Dev Bootcamp.</p>
